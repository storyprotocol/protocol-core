///         record is generated, which references an IP resolver for metadata
///         attribution and an IP account for protocol authorization. Only
///         approved registration modules may register IP into this registry.
///         IMPORTANT: The IP account address, besides being used for protocol
///                    auth, is also the canonical IP identifier for the IP NFT.
