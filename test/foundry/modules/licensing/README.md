Basic assumption: 
A license is to make a derivative

# Starting from Not a derivative

Bob owns IP1
1) If Bob adds 1 Policy in IP -> others can mint if they pass verifications âœ…
1) If Bob doesn't set Policy in IP -> others can't mintâœ…
2) Bob can mint Licenses with whatever Policy in any of the aboveâœ…

3) Bob can add different policies on IP1 without compatibility checks. Others can mint licenses to make derivatives of IP1 from each different policy, as long as they pass the verificationsâœ…

4) Bob can mint licenses with different policies, transfer to others, and the holders can make derivatives from each License, regardless of IP1 having several policies setâœ…
   
5) Bob has set P1 and P2 in IP1, and gets license(LE) with PolicyEmergence(PE) from Emergence's World Bible IP (IPE)
   Bobs wants to set IPE as parent of IP1
    6.1) If the policies that IP1 has are in conflict with PE, revert ðŸš§
    6.2) If the policies that IP1 has are not in conflict with PE, OK -> IP1 adds PE, IPE parent of IP1 ðŸš§
    6.3) Bob disable conflicting policies, then Adds PE ðŸš§

# Starting from A Derivative

Bob owns IP1
Bob creates a license L1 with P1
Alice owns IP2
Alice burns L1, P1 is set in IP2

1) P1 does not allow for derivatives
1.1) Don tries to mint a license from P1 in IP2 -> fails âœ…
1.2) Alice tries to mint a license from P1 in IP2 -> fails âœ…
1.3) Alice tries to set a policy --> fails âœ…

// Edge case, later on, Alice buys the right from her licensor to make derivatives
// Setting the parent again should work in this case, P2 should be
1.4) Bob mints L2 with P2 (allows derivatives) and sends it to Alice 
     Alice burns L2 and P2 is set in IP2 
     Alice can mint now L3 with P2? 


1) P1 allows for derivatives of this derivatives, but meaning P1 propagates down, no other can be set (reciprocal == true) 
2.1) Don tries to mint a license from P1 in IP2 -> License mints, has P1 âœ…
2.2) Alice tries to mint a license from P1 in IP2 -> License mints, has P1 âœ…
2.3) Alice tries to set P2 in IP2 -> Fails, reciprocal means no different policies allowed, 
and you cannot add the same policy twice âœ…


# Setting multiple parents
Bob owns IP1, IP2 and IP3
Bob mints L1 with P1 from IP1
Bob mints L2 with P2 from IP2
Bob mints L3 with P3 from IP3

Alice owns IP4
Alice wants to burn L1,L2 and L3 to link as parents for IP4

1) Reciprocal
1.1) All licenses have the same reciprocal policy -> OK, result has 1 Policy
1.2) Different policies, but at least 1 reciprocal -> Fail

2) NonReciprocal
1.1) All licenses have the same reciprocal policy -> OK, result has 1 Policy
1.2) Different policies, but at least 1 reciprocal -> Fail

P1 - Social Remixing
P2 - Commercial Activity

So we have:
- An original work A, has P1 and P2 set
- People can remix A  into B and B into C, all of with P1
- P2 is permissionless (since it's set on A)
- B can buy License from A with P2 and link if it passes verifications
- C can buy License from A with P2 and link if it passes verification

- P2 is NOT permissionless (commercializers are set ) // TODO: commercializer, whitelist or token gating
- B can buy License from A with P2 and link if CommercializerHelper agrees
- C can buy License from A with P2 and link if CommercializerHelper agrees



# DISPUTED CASES

# Plagiarism
Bob owns IP1 
Bob sets P1 in IP1 (he can, since he clains IP1 is original)
Alice owns IP2
Alice mints L1 from IP1-P1
Alice links IP2 to IP1 with L1
Don finds out IP1 plagiarizes his IP0
Don raises dispute against IP1 for plagiarism
Dispute passes, IP1 is labeled as plagiarism
Bob cannot set policies in IP1
Bob cannot mint licenses from IP1
Alice cannot set policies in IP2
Alice cannot mint licenses from IP2
// TODO: royalties?

# Unnatributed derivative
Bob owns IP1 
Bob sets P1 in IP1 (he can, since he clains IP1 is original)
Alice owns IP2
Alice mints L1 from IP1-P1
Alice links IP2 to IP1 with L1
Don finds out IP1 is a clear derivative of his IP0
Don raises dispute against IP1 for unatributed derivative
Dispute passes, IP1 is labeled as plagiarism
??? Either:
Bob cannot set policies in IP1
Bob cannot mint licenses from IP1
Alice cannot set policies in IP2
Alice cannot mint licenses from IP2
// TODO: royalties?
???? Or:
IP1 is forced to set IP0 as parent, 
All policies from IP1 are disabled and IP0 policy is set instead
// Does this propagate through children/royalties?
