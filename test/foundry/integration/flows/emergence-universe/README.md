Bob registers Skadi IPA via Emergence Policy
We can technically see this being an example of lazy deployment. For example, The resolver shows the Skadi image and other important metadata, but since nothing is being done with Skadi yet, the IPAccount is not yet deployed. (Optional)
Emergence sets some restrictions on what Skadi can do (lets say for example, NO commercial licensing EVER)
At this point, the IPAccount needs to be created in order to set restrictions/access control.
Bob registers Skadi IPA to Magma Policy. How do we know if it is compatible? What happens if it is? What happens if it isn’t? Use some example terms so we can flow through the terms part of the protocol.
Now Bob creates an LNFT of Skadi that Alice obtains, that LNFT stipulates some additional restrictions on top of Emergence’s. Say, anyone with the LNFT can create a derivative, but that derivative cannot allow other derivatives, aka the license tree needs to stop with that derivative and no further ones. How is this additional policy stored and distinguished from the EU policy?
Alice uses that LNFT to create Evil Skadi IPA, a derivative of Skadi IPA. How does this work?
Evil Skadi inherits the restrictions set by a) Emergence b) Magma (? or no?) and c) any additional restrictions/terms Bob has slapped onto the LNFT, such as the restriction from derivatives being made of Evil Skadi.
Evil Skadi generates revenue by selling collectible copies. How does this flow back to both Alice and Bob?
Evil Skadi is copied by Evil Alice without permission. People mistakenly think this is the authentic Evil Skadi made by normal Alice. Evil Skadi generated revenue. How does Evil Skadi get disputed? What happens to the revenue?
